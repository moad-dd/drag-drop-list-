# drag-drop-list-
This web page demonstrates a drag and drop functionality for a list of items. The list consists of various items with images and names. Users can drag and rearrange the items in the list as per their preference.

The interface is designed with a clean and modern look. Each item in the list displays an image along with the corresponding name. The drag handle icon allows users to initiate the drag operation. As the user drags an item, it gains a "dragging" effect to provide visual feedback.

To achieve the drag and drop functionality, the JavaScript code uses event listeners for the dragstart and dragend events to track the dragging state of the items. When an item is being dragged, it is visually highlighted, and upon releasing the item, it reverts to its original state. The dragover event is utilized to determine the drop position of the dragged item within the list.

The CSS styling ensures a responsive layout and enhances the visual presentation of the items and the overall list. The items are displayed in a clean and organized manner with appropriate spacing and borders. The images are circular and fitted within a specific size. The background color and typography choices contribute to an aesthetically pleasing appearance.

This drag and drop list provides an intuitive and interactive user experience, allowing users to customize the order of items easily.

Feel free to customize and integrate this code into your project to create dynamic and user-friendly interfaces.
